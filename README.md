Advanced 4D Printing of Smart Polymers | Research Internship under Dr. Prabir Sarkar, IIT Ropar

Conducted advanced research on the development of adaptive and stimuli-responsive structures through 4D printing, expanding the boundaries of additive manufacturing technologies.

Explored the integration of smart polymers such as PLA and ABS into cutting-edge processes including FDM, SLA, DLP, SLS, and injection moulding, with an emphasis on optimizing design parameters for enhanced shape-memory performance.

Designed, fabricated, and systematically analyzed specimens with varied infill densities, geometries, and patterns, demonstrating how structural design governs thermal responsiveness, actuation, and recovery behavior.

Performed comparative studies across multiple materials and manufacturing methods, highlighting critical insights into structureproperty relationships and validating design strategies for smart material systems.

Contributed to the growing field of adaptive and sustainable manufacturing by establishing innovative pathways for cost-effective 4D-printed components, unlocking future potential in biomedical devices, aerospace, soft robotics, and responsive engineering systems.
